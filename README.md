Wind speed prediction using a 3-state Markov chain and statistical validation in R

# 🌬 Wind Speed Forecasting using Markov Chains

A stochastic modeling project to analyze and predict wind speed transitions using a 3-state Markov Chain in R. Data sourced from Bengaluru's half-hourly wind measurements.

## 🌀 Key Features

- State definitions: Light, Moderate, Strong
- Markov Chain TPM calculation
- Multi-step transition analysis
- Stationary distributions
- State-wise statistics (mean, skewness, MGF)

## 📊 Methods Used

- Markov Chains (Discrete-time)
- Descriptive & Exploratory Analysis
- Skewness, Kurtosis, Moments
- Probability Mass Functions

## 🧰 Tools

- R, base + visualization packages
- CSV preprocessing in Excel
